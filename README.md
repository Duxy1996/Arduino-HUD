# Arduino HUD :bulb:

A simple Heads-Up Display (HUD) project for Arduino.

## Description :rocket:

The Arduino HUD project provides a basic HUD interface for a small screen, allowing you to display information or data in a visually appealing way.

## Quick Start :rocket:

1. Connect the Arduino to your computer.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the "HUD.ino" sketch.
3. Compile and upload the sketch to your Arduino board.
4. Connect the display to the Arduino following the wiring instructions in the "Connections.md" file.
5. Power on the Arduino and the HUD will start displaying information.

## Compilation Manual :gear:

To compile the Arduino HUD project, follow these steps:

1. Install the Arduino IDE from the official Arduino website (https://www.arduino.cc).
2. Open the "HUD.ino" sketch in the Arduino IDE.
3. Select the appropriate board and port from the Tools menu.
4. Click the "Verify" button to compile the code.
5. If there are no errors, you can proceed to upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

## How to Use :computer:

1. Make sure the Arduino and display are properly connected.
2. Power on the Arduino board.
3. The HUD will automatically display the default information.
4. Customize the HUD by modifying the code in the "HUD.ino" sketch.
5. Upload the modified sketch to the Arduino to see the changes.
